## [SOLUTION] Please describe your proposed solution

Let's keep it short and precise.  

**TLDR:**  

- **What:** Local Ambassador workshop pilot  
- **When:** Q1/2025  
- **Where:** Switzerland  
- **Who:** As many Ambassadors in Europe as possible, also inviting members from the Cardano Foundation  
- **Why:** To upskill Cardano Ambassadors as well as improving relations of Ambassadors with each other and as Ambassadors to the Cardano Foundation  
- **Workshop format:** Builder Fest style, unconference  

We will ideate, organise, host and report on an in-person Workshop with local Ambassadors in the style of the Builder Fest #1. We define and battleproof a repeatable playbook from our experiences which can be easily used by other local Ambassador communities around the globe to adapt & adopt the playbook to their own geographical regions.

The main intent is to strengthen the Ambassadors community and to facilitate better relations, alignment and engagements across strongly engaged Cardano contributors.

## [IMPACT] Please define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community

The event is created and specifically set up to trigger and facilitate collaboration among Ambassadors and to increase collectiveness and effectiveness of our ecosystem engagements. Here we are able to meet our fellow ambassadors with which we are able to coordinate already existing projects as well as initiate future projects which we identify as needed or to support each other in onboarding new projects to the Cardano ecosystem.

## [CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY] What is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?

We are a group of well experienced Cardano Ambassadors and meetup organisers, as such it is our passion & expertise to create online & offline events for the Cardano Community. Our experience and skill sets ensure a successful implementation of the proposal.

## [VALUE FOR MONEY] How does the cost of the project represent value for money for the Cardano ecosystem?

**Community Strengthening:**  
The proposed Ambassador Workshop aims to strengthen the Cardano Ambassadors' network by fostering in-person collaboration, which enhances both existing projects and the development of new initiatives. This adds value by improving ecosystem engagement and increasing collective project coordination.

**Skill Development:**  
By upskilling Ambassadors, the workshop ensures that the participants can take these skills back to their local communities, further strengthening Cardano's presence and impact in different regions.
