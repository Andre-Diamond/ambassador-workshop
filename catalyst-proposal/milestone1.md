## Report on Deliverables

### Setup Communication hub for project coordination
To communicate and coordinate, we have Cardano Foundation who provided us with a dedicated channel for this project on the private Cardano Ambassadors Slack by Cardano Foundation. 

Furthermore, several individual discord chats help in 1:1 coordinations 

### Open a new cardano-multisig wallet to manage proposal funds
We created a multisignature account, using the Mesh Multisig platform, where we receive and distribute proposal funding. 
The Wallet addr1: addr1z9hjmttg9z4t7jsvanuw4geptnd7x9n5crvltmy9ad80kfuafhxhu32dys6pvn6wlw8dav6cmp4pmtv7cc3yel9uu0nqjzs262
