## Report on Deliverables

### Setup Communication hub for project coordination
To communicate and coordinate, we have Cardano Foundation who provided us with a dedicated channel for this project on the private Cardano Ambassadors Slack by Cardano Foundation. 

Furthermore, several individual discord chats help in 1:1 coordinations 

A Respective X Account through which event details will be made to the public has been initiated
- https://x.com/Ambassador_work 

### Open a new cardano-multisig wallet to manage proposal funds
Changes to first PoA:
- We created a multisignature account, using the Mesh Multisig platform where we receive and distribute proposal funding. 
- The Wallet addr1: addr1xymgnqqlemvc5a6a6n7n3spyxr0t8264a4ys6aflcnqf77tmnylfxupxj8y36hvrnm4k5n828e8stxk3agejrjm4fh9q9anrm6
- The multisignature wallet now consists of 5 signers

Multisignature signers:
- Felix (Cardano Ambassador) 
- Hinson (Cardano Ambassador) 
- Nori Nishigaya (Cardano Ambassador) 
- Simon (Cardano Ambassador) 
- Yoram (Cardano Ambassador) 

The quorum of the multisig is set to 3/5.

### Create and launch an event website
We created and launched the initial Event Website where we will regularly update and add content as the project evolves. 
Changes to first PoA:
- we added workshop details such as dates & location (Cant state exact location yet as the confirmation & booking of the venue is part of Milestone2)
- we added a sign up form for Ambassadors to sign up for the workshop
- we added the missing x-account, linked at the header menu from which we will share event details in public as soon as public information are available at Milestone 2 and 3.
 
You can find the website at: 
- https://ambassador-workshop.netlify.app/ 

The respective open source github repository for the project where we host the code and proposal milestone reports can be found at:
- https://github.com/Technosophorso/ambassador-workshop

### And thats it...
For this Milestone, we hope that the provided deliverables match the Milestone Reviewers acceptance criteria.

Yet, notice to the Milestone Reviewers:
- providing the exact workshop location as you requested is a deliverable of Milestone 2 since this can only come with the confimation and booking of the venue which is not a deliverable of this milestone
- providing photos as you requested is a deliverable of Milestone 3 since we can only share photos once the event is concluded
